### Steps

- learn the concept
- solve a problem with it
- maybe implement it (code, white board & google docs)
- analyse complexity
- add tests
- practice problems online (leetcode, hackerrank)

### Data Structures

- Array
- Maps (WeakMap)
- Sets (WeakSet)
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Hash table
- Hash set
- Binary trees
- Heap
- Graphs
  - directed
  - undirected
  - adjacency matrix
  - adjacency list
  - traversals: BFS, DFS
